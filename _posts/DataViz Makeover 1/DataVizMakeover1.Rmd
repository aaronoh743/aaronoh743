# 1. Introduction

For the first DataViz makeover assignment, I will be looking at Merchandise Trade by Region/Market, with data extracted from the Department of Statistics (DOS), Singapore. I will be looking at the import and export numbers from 6 countries - Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, United States. 

The data is made available under the sub-section of [Merchandise Trade by Region/Market](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data).

# 2. Objectives

This chart aims to show imports and exports trends of the top six countries historically with the highest trade. This is important as a country's imports and exports activity can affect her Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exchange rate, inflation and interest rates. By understanding the patterns, policy-makers are able to look into country-specific trade strategies that may overcome any deficits.  

# 3. Evaluation of the original visualisation

I will first examine the original visualisation from the data (Figure 1) and critique based on the clarity and aesthetics. 

![Figure 1: Original Chart of Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019-2020](Image/Original_Visual.jpg)

## 3.1. Clarity

a. Chart labels (y-axis) are inconsistent for all six countries. For instance, Hong Kong's exports uses $2M interval while imports uses $200K interval. This gives an inaccurate first impression that imports have exceeded exports for some months.Similarly, by comparing between countries, it seems that Malaysia and Taiwan have similar imports and exports numbers. Upon closer look, it is observed that Malaysia has twice the amount of exports compared to Taiwan. 

b. Chart labels are presented in millions(M) and thousands(K). Upon closer inspection of the raw dataset, the data is presented in '000, which indicates that the actual trade values are in nominations of billions. 

c. The period (x-axis) presented in the chart is inconsistent with the title. Japan only had data from 2020, while the remaining countries have data presented from 2019-2021. The chart title showed 2019-2020 instead. Nonetheless, the title was clear in showing the reasons for choosing the top six countries.

d. Y-Axis is not properly labeled with units. It could be misinterpreted as trade volume instead of trade amount.X-axis is clear. 

e. There could be a short paragraph summarising the objectives of the visualisation. This might give the reader a clearer picture.


## 3.2. Aesthetics

a. Area graph may not be the most appropriate chart. Due to the overlapping colours, it is difficult to visualise the export trends when its value falls below import value. A line graph might be more appropriate.  

b. Usage of colours in the chart is consistent, and easy to differentiate. 

c. There could be annotations on the graph to highlight key observations and provide a cleaner look to the entire presentation. 

# 4. Proposed Graphical Representation

## 4.1. Sketch 

In this section, I will proposed an alternative graphical representation of the data. 

![Figure 2: Proposed Graphical Representation](Image/sketch_1.jpg){width=75%}

## 4.2. Advatanges of proposed design

1. I have replaced the area graph with a line graph. This will allow better view of the data especially if there are any overlaps.

2. The y-axis of both imports and exports have the same interval. This will give a more accurate representation when comparing within and across the countries. 

3. Derived a new measure called net exports to understand if there are any trade deficit/surplus with certain countries. The data is aggregated by years to understand the change in net exports in 2019 and 2020. 



# 5. Step-by-step description for the makeover

In this section, I will be providing a step-by-step guide for the makeover in Tableau. I will make use of 2 tables:  
**T1:** Merchandise Imports By Region/Market, Monthly  
**T2:** Merchandise Exports By Region/Market, Monthly  

## 5.1. Data Preparation (I)

1. Remove the rows 1-5 from Excel T1 and T2 to facilitate upload onto Tableau.

![Figure 3: Removing unncessary rows from Excel](Image/Dataclean_1.png){width=50%}

2. Create a new Tableau Worksheet, and connect to the cleaned excel file.

![Figure 4: Connecting to data source](Image/Clean_1.jpg){width=75%}

3. Three tables corresponding to three worksheet in the excel file is extracted. 

![Figure 5: Connecting to data source](Image/Clean_2.jpg){width=75%}


4. Drag T1 into the workspace and the data points will be automatically populated. 

![Figure 6: Configuring T1 - Imports](Image/Clean_3.jpg){width=75%}

5. Filter the data based on the period specified (Jan 2019 - Dec 2020).

![Figure 7: Filter out the relevant period](Image/Clean_5.jpg){width=75%}

6. Pivot the data (except the first column) to get a thinner table suitable for visualisation. I have also renamed the 3 new columns as Period, Imports and Countries respectively. 

![Figure 8: Pivot the table](Image/Clean_6.jpg){width=75%}

7. Change the data type of the period from string to date

![Figure 9: Changing the data type](Image/Clean_7.jpg){width=75%}

8. Extract the table and save it as T1(outputFile)

![Figure 10: Extract the table](Image/Clean_8.jpg){width=100%}

9. Repeat the same process for T2, and save it as T2(outputFile)

## 5.2. Data Preparation (II)

10. Open a new workbook and import T1(outputFile) and T2(outputFile)

11. We will first process T1(outputFile). Filter the data based on the countries (Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, US, Malaysia and Japan)

![Figure 11: Filter out the relevant countries](Image/Clean_4.jpg){width=100%}

12. Toggle to T2(OutputFile) and drag the table into the workspace. This creates a join between the two tables.

![Figure 12: Joining T1 and T2 together](Image/Clean_9.jpg){width=100%}
13. Rename the new fields accordingly. Period (Imports, Exports), Imports, Exports, Countries (Imports, Exports)

14. Click on the join setting. Inner join is used on period and countries of both tables.
![Figure 13: Inner join](Image/Clean_10.jpg){width=80%}

15. Create a new calculated field to convert imports and exports into the billion scale.
![Figure 14: Customising filter workspace](Image/Clean_22.jpg){width=100%}


## 5.3. Creating Visualisations - Imports and Exports

16. First, I will create 6 different line charts showcasing imports and exports on a dual axis. I will illustrate with Hong Kong.

17. Drag Countries (Imports) into the filters workspace. Select Hong Kong from the filter pop-up. Repeat for Countries (Exports)

![Figure 15: Customising filter workspace](Image/Clean_11.jpg){width=100%}

18. Drag other dimensions and measures into the columns and rows. For show both imports and exports as a single plot, right click on the exports plot and select "Dual Axis".

![Figure 16: Creating the plot](Image/Clean_12.jpg){width=100%}

19. Next, customisation of the x and y-axis can be done by double clicking on the axis. This ensures consistency in the axis intervals.

![Figure 17: Customising the y-axis](Image/Clean_13.jpg){width=100%}

![Figure 18: Customising the x-axis](Image/Clean_14.jpg){width=100%}

20. Repeat the same steps for the remaining 5 countries in different worksheets. 


## 5.4. Creating Visualisations - Net Exports

21. In this section, we will be creating another visualisation that shows the net exports of the top six countries. 

22. I will first create a new measure called Net Exports.

![Figure 19: Creating a new measure](Image/Clean_15.jpg){width=100%}

23. A pop-up will appear. Key in "[Exports] - [Imports]" in the space provided to derive net exports. 

![Figure 20: Entering formula for Net Exports](Image/Clean_16.jpg){width=50%}

24. Drag dimensions and measures into the respective columns, rows, filters and marks. Note that the period is set to Year, to aggregate the net exports yearly. 

![Figure 21: Creating the plot](Image/Clean_17.jpg){width=100%}
25. Next, I have created a line chart to show the percentage of net exports aggregated by year. Similar to step 18, to choose dual-axis for the 2 graphs to overlap. 

![Figure 22: Creating an additional line chart](Image/Clean_23.jpg){width=75%}

26. Next, I have created 2 more measures, to differentiate between positive net exports (trade surplus) and negative net exports (trade deficit). This is done by creating a new calculated field, and the IF function.These new measures will be added to the line graph labels under the marks workspace.

![Figure 23: Creating additional measures for positive and negative differentiation](Image/Clean_24.jpg){width=75%}

![Figure 24: Replace net exports measure with ](Image/Clean_26.jpg){width=25%}

27. Finally, I have annotated the % change in net exports between 2019 and 2020.

![Figure 25: Creating additional measures for positive and negative differentiation](Image/Clean_25.jpg){width=75%}

## 5.5. Dashboarding - Putting everything together

28. Create new dashboard worksheet, and the individual charts created previously would appear on the left side Tableau Desktop.

![Figure 26: Creating the dashboard](Image/Clean_18.jpg){width=100%}

29. For this dashboard, I have decided to use Automatic as the size and used the floating method to position the different visualisations. Tableau will automatically resize depending on the displayed screen. 

![Figure 27: Setting the dashboard](Image/Clean_20.jpg){width=75%}

30. The final layout of the dashboard is shown in Figure 20 below. The dashboard is also published on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVizMakeover1_16220949122280/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

![Figure 28: Final Dashboard](Image/Clean_21.jpg){width=100%}

# 6. Observations

1. There is an increase in net exports from China (+175%) and United States (+186%) between 2019 and 2020. Upon closer inspection, it is noted the increase is due to the decreasing imports from these countries, while exports remained relatively stable (some seasonal fluctuations are observed). As Singapore is heavily dependent on imports for many commodities items, it might be an are of interest for the policy-makers in this area.  

2. There is a decrease in net exports from 2019-2020 from Malaysia (-161%) and Japan (-340%), resulting in a larger proportion of trade deficit. Specifically for Malaysia, there is a dip in imports and exports in Apr 2020, which accounts for a higher margin for the deficit. 

3. Hong Kong records a significant level of trade surplus while Taiwan shows an opposite trend, a trade deficit. This has been rather consistent throughout 2019-2020. With regard to this trend, it might not be alarming should there be existing arrangements between Singapore and these countries i.e trade surplus/deficient is a known fact. However, should this be a new trend, it might be a good opportunity for Singapore to relook into country-specific strategies to strengthen international trade.
