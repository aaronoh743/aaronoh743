<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>For the past 20 years, Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos. They have been largely successful in generating profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. Unfortunately, their business has not been successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship with the Protectors of Kronos (POK). In January 2014, several employees of GAStech went missing in the midst of a celebration. POK is suspected in the disappearances.</p>
<p>In this mini-challenge, we are tasked to investigate the relationships and conditions that led up to the kidnapping. I will be answering the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources?</p></li>
<li><p>Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="literature-review">2. Literature Review</h1>
<p>By definition, primary sources are first-hand account of an event and typically represent an original view, reporting on discoveries and events, or sharing new information. A derivative source, on the other hand, typically involves an analysis and/or interpretation of the primary sources. Given the definitions, derivative sources have 2 main traits - (1) similar content to the primary source(s) and (2)published after the primary sources.Using these traits, it is likely to create a network between the primary and secondary sources, and subsequently deep-dive to understand what are the articles discussing.</p>
<h1 id="question-1-analysis">3. Question 1 Analysis</h1>
<p>Before we can begin analysing the questions, I will first set up the packages required for this project. It can be done with the code chunk listed below.</p>

Swaying, the protesters sang well-known protest songs, including &quot;This is Our Land&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Farmer&quot; and &quot;The Weavers of our Homeland&quot;   When the federal police began arresting the POK protesters, they moved in an orderly fashion into the waiting police van, singing the entire time.

Marek asks all concerned citizens to join her to bring awareness to the problem of political corruption and favoritism pervasive in the offices of the government of Kronos.    &quot;I&#39;m calling for an end to the heinous corruption, the nepotism and the favoritism displayed by our elected officials&quot;

Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as &quot;landmark&quot; and &quot;bettering the people&quot;.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?
4  NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination.   This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community&#39;s anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.    ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.   Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  &quot;The gas company had been built a few years back in &#39;94, and our problems didn&#39;t start right away.   The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.   Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.   With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.   &quot;We&#39;ve made a good living for a long time,&quot; Reese tells me.   I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech&#39;s operations.     I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.

I&#39;ve asked  Elodis Weekly Journal editor Pondo Resses to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community&#39;s struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country&#39;s food.   &quot;It took a long time for anyone to respond,&quot; Reese tells me of their struggle.  &quot;Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn&#39;t give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that&#39;s where we started.&quot;   Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We&#39;re currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.&quot;

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today&#39;s elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.   Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.     How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.   &quot;We have a meeting planned with the Minister,&quot; Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.   Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.

He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses.&quot;   The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.

A Protectors of Kronos official made the following statment: &quot;Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian&#39;s death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice.&quot;  Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech.    Calls to the President&#39;s office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.

<li>As such, we will only want to keep the correlation where the published date in the from column is earlier than the to column. This will ensure that the network graph plotted later will only show the primary sources pointing to the secondary sources.

<li><p>Upon closer inspection, while some of the email subjects might indicate some personal relationship (casino nights, planning for staff picnic), they are in fact events initiated by the company and seemed to be sent to all employees. We will ignore these emails.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, an observation from the network analysis showed that 2 staff have the most number of correspondence with the employees. They are namely, Linnea Bergan and Ruscella Mies Haber from the administration team. Upon closer inspection in the email headers, we can conclude that they typically send group emails to the employees with regard to administrative and Information Technology related topics. As such, the information might not be as useful in determining relationships and will be excluded in the analysis below.</p></li>
<li><p>In the next few steps, I will summarise some of the relationships between employees based on the email topics.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CEO Sten Sanjorge Network</strong></p>

<p>From the network graph, we can tell that Sten has frequent communication between his Executive team presumbly on the outcomes of the business. However, we can use the datatable to determine what kind of correspondences are happening between his co-workers.</p>

</figure>
<p>It seemed that Sten has personal relationships with Ada Campo, Orhan Strum and William Vasco as there were emails going back and forth with regards to an impromptu golf game and seeking for recommendation for a good vacation spot. Ingrid Barranco only spoke to Sten with regard to work events only.</p>
<p>Another correspondence is with Henk Mies, a Truck Driver from the Facilities department. Unfortunately, we only have the subject title of the email and is only labelled files. We will assume that this is a work incident that requires CEO’s attention.</p>

<p><strong>Facilities Department Network</strong></p>
<p>The facilities department seemingly have a close personal relationship with one another, seemingly from the Guys Night Out invite extended to the department. The information can be retrieved from the data table.</p>

<p>However, it might interesting to note that Bertrand Ovan, being the Facilities Group Manager, did not any correspondence with other departments.Instead, any cross departmental communications were managed by the other team members. For instance, the preparation for the January 20 VIP meeting was managed primarily by Emile Arpa, a janitor by designation. The instructions were primarily initiated by Emile to other departments.</p>

<p>Another staff, Benito Hawelon, also has personal correspondace with Felix Resumir regarding a coffee run and GASTech announcements. This could indicate some form of personal relationship between the two employees. This is an unique email between both employees and does not include others.</p>
