<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>For the past 20 years, Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos. They have been largely successful in generating profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. Unfortunately, their business has not been successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship with the Protectors of Kronos (POK). In January 2014, several employees of GAStech went missing in the midst of a celebration. POK is suspected in the disappearances.</p>
<p>In this mini-challenge, we are tasked to investigate the relationships and conditions that led up to the kidnapping. I will be answering the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources?</p></li>
<li><p>Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="literature-review">2. Literature Review</h1>
<p>By definition, primary sources are first-hand account of an event and typically represent an original view, reporting on discoveries and events, or sharing new information. A derivative source, on the other hand, typically involves an analysis and/or interpretation of the primary sources. Given the definitions, derivative sources have 2 main traits - (1) similar content to the primary source(s) and (2)published after the primary sources.Using these traits, it is likely to create a network between the primary and secondary sources, and subsequently deep-dive to understand what are the articles discussing.</p>
<h1 id="question-1-analysis">3. Question 1 Analysis</h1>
<p>Before we can begin analysing the questions, I will first set up the packages required for this project. It can be done with the code chunk listed below.</p>

Swaying, the protesters sang well-known protest songs, including &quot;This is Our Land&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Farmer&quot; and &quot;The Weavers of our Homeland&quot;   When the federal police began arresting the POK protesters, they moved in an orderly fashion into the waiting police van, singing the entire time.

Marek asks all concerned citizens to join her to bring awareness to the problem of political corruption and favoritism pervasive in the offices of the government of Kronos.    &quot;I&#39;m calling for an end to the heinous corruption, the nepotism and the favoritism displayed by our elected officials&quot;

Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as &quot;landmark&quot; and &quot;bettering the people&quot;.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community&#39;s anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.    ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.   Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  &quot;The gas company had been built a few years back in &#39;94, and our problems didn&#39;t start right away.   The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.   Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.   With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.   &quot;We&#39;ve made a good living for a long time,&quot; Reese tells me.   I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech&#39;s operations.     I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.

I&#39;ve asked  Elodis Weekly Journal editor Pondo Resses to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community&#39;s struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country&#39;s food.   &quot;It took a long time for anyone to respond,&quot; Reese tells me of their struggle.  &quot;Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn&#39;t give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that&#39;s where we started.&quot;   Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We&#39;re currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.&quot;

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today&#39;s elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.   Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.     How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.   &quot;We have a meeting planned with the Minister,&quot; Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.   Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.

He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses.&quot;   The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.

A Protectors of Kronos official made the following statment: &quot;Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian&#39;s death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice.&quot;  Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech.    Calls to the President&#39;s office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.

guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as \"landmark\" and \"bettering the people\".  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?","The Elodis Community Health Center has published an update to the Wellness for All study performed in 1998.  The full report will soon be posted on the Elodis municipal website.","Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.  He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses.\"   The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.","In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.   Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, \"I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.\"  Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.   \"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community,\" Karel said at a rally a few months ago.  \"Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?\"  The police representative assured supporters who amassed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.  F  Attorney Michale Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.","In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.   \"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,\" Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.   \"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel. By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann.\"   \"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.   \"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.\"   Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.","Following the annual GAStech-Kronos corporate meeting GAStech executives and several high-ranking Kronos government officials will attend a celebration at the Kronos capital building to celebrate the unfettered kleptocracy that has kept Kronos public officials in mansions and luxury vehicles.","Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.   Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"  As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.   Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.   Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.     \"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\"","For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.   Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.","About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.   In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both \"natural gas and the drilling process are clean.\" The statement continued, \"If our people are sick we will help them get well. That is the duty of government: to protect its people.\"","After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.    The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed.   Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, \"The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract.\"","President Dorel Kapelou II has won re-election with the largest margin ever in a Kronesian election.   President Kapelou II of the Democratic Party of Kronos captured 98.7% of the vote with Ren Touvi of the Organization of Business and Unions Party a distant second with a mere 1.0% of the vote.    With all the votes counted the President's Democratic Party of Kronos now holds 85 seats in the General Assembly, 13 for the Organization of Business and Unions Party, and 2 for the Party of Kronos Industrialists.","AWELON, CYNTHE / DOB: 3/20/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: DRUG PARAPHERNALIA    BLUMIAU, WILLEM / DOB: 2/15/1995 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (HASHISH); PEDESTRN SUBJECT TO SIGNAL   CUSEMA, BRITA / DOB: 1/7/1992 / Time of Arrest: 2205 hrs / Accused of: THEFT SHOPLIFTING-5TH DEGREE   DUNNA, THAD / DOB: 9/20/1974 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE   GUDENZ, KEL / DOB: 7/2/1995 / Time of Arrest: 1630 hrs / Accused of: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL; DWLU   HOLANDE, ANDA / DOB: 3/26/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: IMPROPER BRAKE LIGHT   KIBALIAU, IYAN / DOB: 4/3/1994 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE   MORDECAI, FRANCISCO / DOB: 3/17/1971 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: PUBLIC INTOXICATION; POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (Heroin)   PEAIRS, MELSHA / DOB: 8/31/1952 / Time of Arrest: 1330 hrs / Accused of: FORGERY   SALANIAU, FERDINAND / DOB: 2/17/1982 / Time of Arrest: 0832 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE;","The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly elected new President Dorel Kapelou II. Former President Luis Araullo conceded defeat yesterday when early returns came in strong for Kapelou II.   The results for the 1 October election are as follows: Dorel Kapelou II elected with 62% of the vote and Luis Araullo receiving just 36% of the vote. A resounding victory for the new elected President and a clear mandate for Kapelou's vision for the country.","A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. Edvard Vann, a GAStech Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.   A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.","A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning.    Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.    While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them.","Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence.    The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.   Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area.

He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann.\" Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of \"Remember Juliana!\" to fade. \"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face.\" \"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.\" Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard   Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This \"thorough investigation\" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?\" Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  \"Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!\"","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard   In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> Continue reading the main story\t The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon. \"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.  Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.  Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities. Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.  Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.  Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.  \"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" SanJorge said. \"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\"  Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.  \"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\"","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani   Police spokesman Adrien Carmen informed the media today that members of the POK assaulted a police patrol in Abila early this morning.

Police informed reporters that four of the GAStech employees whose whereabouts were unconfirmed yesterday were found overnight, leaving ten people who are presumed missing.","The Elodis Community Health Center has published an update to the Wellness for All study performed in 1998.","GAStech International, as projected earlier this month, reported record fiscal 1998 profit of $110 million.   \"GAStech International has delivered another year of superior financial performance achieved through a consistent vision and expert execution,\" Sten Sanjorge, Jr., GAStech's Chief Executive, said in a brief statement.","A motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.","After four years of diminishing health following a major heart attack, Sten Sanjorge, Sr. has died.  Sanjorge, Sr., 65, of Centrum, Tethys was President Emeritus of GAStech International having founded the company in 1961. is survived by his wife Ingrid Sanjorge and his son Sten Sanjorge, Jr.","Police spokesman Adrien Carmen informed the media today that members of the POK assaulted a police patrol in Abila early this morning.  The POK thugs crept up on two patrol officers who were sitting in their vehicle and ambushed the men, bashing the windows of their car and dragging them out of the vehicle into the street.","Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.","The Elodis Community Health Center has published an update to the Wellness for All study performed in 1998.","The real gross domestic product - the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in Kronos - increased at an annual rate of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 1999, according to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economics.","President and CEO of GAStech International Sten Sanjorge, Jr. The filings show that the GAStech - Kronos executives earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum.","Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence.   The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.  Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens.   A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including \"Justice for Elian\" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and \"Remember Juliana\", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.  The Kronos government issued a statement, \"This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable.\"","President Dorel Kapelou II has won re-election with the largest margin ever in a Kronesian election. The people of Kronos have stood together and announced a bright new day with a resounding vote of confidence for the President.  President Kapelou II of the Democratic Party of Kronos captured 98.7% of the vote with Ren Touvi of the Organization of Business and Unions Party a distant second with a mere 1.0% of the vote.   With all the votes counted the President's Democratic Party of Kronos now holds 85 seats in the General Assembly, 13 for the Organization of Business and Unions Party, and 2 for the Party of Kronos Industrialists.   From every corner of Kronos could be heard a chorus of Kronos, Be Ever True to Thee.","After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.   The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, \"pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation.\"  Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, \"The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract.\"  The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.","A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.  There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.  At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.  A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.  January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.","The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly elected new President Dorel Kapelou II. Former President Luis Araullo conceded defeat yesterday when early returns came in strong for Kapelou II. Today marks a new dawn for the people of Kronos and a bright path forward for the country.  The results for the 1 October election are as follows: Dorel Kapelou II elected with 62% of the vote and Luis Araullo receiving just 36% of the vote. A resounding victory for the new elected President and a clear mandate for Kapelou's vision for the country.","For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.  Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal.\"  Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.","A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning.   Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.   While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.","AWELON, CYNTHE / DOB: 3/20/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: DRUG PARAPHERNALIA   BLUMIAU, WILLEM / DOB: 2/15/1995 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (HASHISH); FOREIGN WARRANT   BODROGI, CARMINE / 12/1/1993 / Time of Arrest: 0230 hrs / Accused of: POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMC); INTENT TO DELIVER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMC)  COARDA, SEVE / DOB: 5/13/1979 / Time of Arrest: 1248 hrs / Accused of: PEDESTRN FAILING TO USE CROSSWALK; PEDESTRN SUBJECT TO SIGNAL  CUSEMA, BRITA / DOB: 1/7/1992 / Time of Arrest: 2205 hrs / Accused of: THEFT SHOPLIFTING-5TH DEGREE  DUNNA, THAD / DOB: 9/20/1974 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE  GUDENZ, KEL / DOB: 7/2/1995 / Time of Arrest: 1630 hrs / Accused of: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL; DWLU  HOLANDE, ANDA / DOB: 3/26/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: IMPROPER BRAKE LIGHT  KIBALIAU, IYAN / DOB: 4/3/1994 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE  MORDECAI, FRANCISCO / DOB: 3/17/1971 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: PUBLIC INTOXICATION; POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (Heroin)  PEAIRS, MELSHA / DOB: 8/31/1952 / Time of Arrest: 1330 hrs / Accused of: FORGERY  SALANIAU, FERDINAND / DOB: 2/17/1982 / Time of Arrest: 0832 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE; POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMA)","About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River.

During the press conference Sanjorge, Jr. spoke of the new logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to \"help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative.\" He also referenced that the tri-part flame represents the past, present, and future of the company in that by keeping \"one eye on the past we know from where we came - our humble beginnings; one eye on the future we will know where we are going - our coming success; and both feet planted in the present we will be proactive in an ever-changing, competitive industry.\"  Finally, Sanjorge, Jr. asserted GAStech International's \"blue flame is an enduring beacon of environmental responsibility, and a symbol of a clean energy business moving forward.\"   This rebranding process and new logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 protest at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several arrests. The protest and others in and around Abila, the capital of Kronos, have been in response to alleged water contamination issues and a lack of Government and GAStech response.  Sten Sanjorge, Jr. declined to comment directly on questions regarding protests and environmental contamination. He deflected, \"Today is a great day for GAStech.

This marks the 5th year in a row with positive GDP growth for the developing country. Most of this growth can be contributed to the relationship between the Government of Kronos and GAStech International.","After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila.   Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place.   Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event.

As high-income countries from Europe and the United States race to take advantage of existing and potential gas deposits, Kronos is planning to provide incentives such as reducing corporate and individual tax, preferential tariffs, and derogations from regulations as well as cheap, but eager work force.  The Government of Kronos is pitching the plan as a win-win situation given that the high-income countries will be struggling to discover and exploit ever-dwindling supplies of fossil-fuels and the developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>   Continue reading the main story    The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.   \"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.   Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.   Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market.   Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.   Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources.   GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.   Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.   Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.   \"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry."],"TITLE":["LACK OF DETAILS MARS GOVERNMENT INTENTIONS","ELODIS PUBLIC HEALTH FACT SHEET 2004","POK REPRESENTATIVES MEET WITH KRONOS MINISTER OF
