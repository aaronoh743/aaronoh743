following an dispute at the gates of the Tiskele Bend GAStech facility.  Swaying, the protesters sang well-known protest songs, including \"This is Our Land\", \"Songs of the Farmer\" and \"The Weavers of our Homeland\"   When the federal police began arresting the POK protesters, they moved in an orderly fashion into the waiting police van, singing the entire time.","Silvia Marek, leader of the Protectors of Kronos social action organization is appealing to the citizens of Kronos to join her for a day of peaceful protest tomorrow.  Marek asks all concerned citizens to join her to bring awareness to the problem of political corruption and favoritism pervasive in the offices of the government of Kronos.    \"I'm calling for an end to the heinous corruption, the nepotism and the favoritism displayed by our elected officials\"","In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as \"landmark\" and \"bettering the people\".  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?","NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination.   This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.    ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.   Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.   Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.   With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.   \"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me.   I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.     I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.","NOTE: This article is the last installment of a three  This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.  I've asked  Elodis Weekly Journal editor Pondo Resses to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.   \"It took a long time for anyone to respond,\" Reese tells me of their struggle.  \"Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started.\"   Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.\"","The Elodis Community Health Center has published an update to the Wellness for All study performed in 1998.  The full report will soon be posted on the Elodis municipal website.","ABILA, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters, of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.   Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.     How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?","A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly.   This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.   \"We have a meeting planned with the Minister,\" Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.   Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.","Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.  He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses.\"   The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.","Elian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.  A Protectors of Kronos official made the following statment: \"Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice.\"  Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech.    Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.","ELODIS, Kronos - A vehicle collision claimed the lives of an Elodis family, including two children Tuesday afternoon.  The family was traveling home from a school program where one of the children had performed in the Spring Program at Elodis Primary School.   Elodis Assistant Police Commissioner Adian Koppolis reported three of the victims died at the scene of the accident.  Marcellus Edris, 33, his wife Valeria, 30, their daughter Celia, 7 died at the scene of the accident.   The unidentified 25-year old driver of the GAStech truck was held overnight in the Elodis city jail, and then released.   Commissioner Koppolis said Elodis police would conduct a full investigation.","Minister of Health Cesare Nespola announced he would sponsor a bill to increase taxes on foreign energy development in Kronos intended to fund environmental cleanup and improved healthcare for rural towns.  Following a series of meetings with members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) the announcement was made last week.  \"We fight for clean water, good health and now we will have the funds to make this happen\", stated POK spokesperson Carmine Osvaldo. Osvaldo invoked the memory of Juliana Vann, a 10-year old girl who died last year from leukemia due to with benzene poisoning from gas drilling operations upstream from her home.   The POK formed in 1997 in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and subsequent deaths of local residents.","At the request of the citizens of Elodis, Wellness for All has published a report on the impact of gas drilling operations on water quality and public health.  Comparative data prior to 1998 was obtained from a thorough investigating of medical record provided by Elodis Community Health Center.   Report Highlights   * Elevated amounts of toxic chemicals were found in the water supply, including arsenic, acetic anhydride, benzene, and chlorine dioxide.   * Persons younger than 30 appear to be suffering an unusually high rate of chronic illness associated with toxins produced by gas drilling operations.","In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.   Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, \"I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.\"  Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.   \"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community,\" Karel said at a rally a few months ago.  \"Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?\"  The police representative assured supporters who amassed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.  F  Attorney Michale Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.","In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.   \"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,\" Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.   \"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel. By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann.\"   \"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.   \"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.\"   Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.","Following the annual GAStech-Kronos corporate meeting GAStech executives and several high-ranking Kronos government officials will attend a celebration at the Kronos capital building to celebrate the unfettered kleptocracy that has kept Kronos public officials in mansions and luxury vehicles.","Thousands of people lined the roads on Thursday in a display of antigovernment solidarity.    Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.  \"This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event.\"   He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies.   Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.","Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.   Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"  As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.   Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.   Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.     \"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\"","A long day of the contradictory reports and muddling information finished. What we know for certain that 14 employees of GAStech missing, as confirmed by a source of government of Kronos. Currently it is not very clear how they disappeared  and if they are citizens of Kronos or Tethys, as many employees of GAStech are Tethan.  There is speculation concerning akidnapping and if president de GAStech and ifPRESIDENT Sten St. George Jr. were the target.  Currently nobody claimed the responsibility for kidnapping. Edvard Vann, GAStech, the guard of safety which was questioned and released after 6 a.m., gave the indication which the guards of Kronos were implied or at least suspectés as being the criminals behind events of today.  An international director of safety of GAStech was on the building site to support research helping the department of police force of Abila and the civils servant of government of Kronos.  On January 20 was the meeting of the annual company of GAStech with a reception of government of Kronos to be followed. Little time after the morning the meeting was closed with 10:00, trucks of department of fire of Abila answered the reports of a fire at the office of GAStech.","ABILA, Kronos - the fueler Ravi Danisliau of airport of Abila confirmed that two voyage out of jet separated today after being filled with fuel.   According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were \"businesses types\" and seemed to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were directed. The plane took off about local time of Kronos 12:30.   The second plane also carried seven or eight \"of the businesses type\", but seemed \"more relaxed much than the first group of passengers\". Danisliau indicated the second group of passengers \"seemed to celebrate something.\" The second plane left towards 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.  Danisliau confirmed that the second destination of the plane was Rome, Italy.  Between the two private planes, fourteen to sixteen could have been of the momentary ones. This easily could explain the departure of the control of GAStech - Kronos.   Once asked whether the two planes had anything to make with GAStech, Danisliau answered, \"I do not pose many the questions. I filled of fuel right planes.\"","the people of Kronos elected new President Dorel Kapelou II. defeat conceded by Araullo of Former President Luis yesterday when the returns early came in fort for Kapelou II. Mark today a new start for the people of Kronos and a luminous way ahead for the country.  The results for the election of October 1 are as follows: Dorel Kapelou II elected with 62% of the vote and of Shine Araullo receiving 36% of the vote just. A resounding victory for the new elected president and a clear mandate for the vision of Kapelou for the country.","During roughly 6 hours employed Edvard Vann de GAStech - of Kronos was questioned by Kronos Police and civils servant of government before being released with 17:00 this evening. Apparent confusion comes from the similarity between its name and that from a guard from member from Kronos.  Vann, a guard of safety for GAStech, was furious, stating, \"I do not have anything to make some with any member of group POK of terrorist. I do not know anybody of Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Is being marked and being questioned during 6 hours as a member of terrorist POK one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him with a criminal.\"  Although it was charged not to communicate with the pressure that Vann was determined to subject to a constraint its innocence. With approximately 14 still unexplained  missing employees of GAStech, one cannot blame the police force or the government not to leave any stone unturned.","A government investigation concluded that an accident between a GAStech vehicle and an Elodis family, which killed all four members of the Elodis family, was caused by driver error by the Elodis driver.   The spokesman Rufus Drymiau of the Kronos government said that research found the fatalaccident was started when the driver of Elodis crossed into oncoming traffic. Three occupants - Valeria Edris, Celia Edris, and Marcellus Edris - died in the scene.    armine Edria, 9, was found wndering around the accident site. He succumbed to his injuries later at the hospital of Abila.   The driver of truck of GAStech received minor injury and was taken at the hospital for observations.  In an exposure of the international wishes of GAStech of generosity of corporation to give the money to the remaining members of family.","The international health of group of conscience of water for all (WFA) carried out the test on local water in finding Elodis on high level of dangerous materials in the residential water wells.   In a reportreleased by WFA, the group directs the blame towards the government of international Kronos and GAStech, a natural gas company of Tethys. In addition to directing blame WFA also require that the two clean tops the contamination, which includes the high levels of benzene, the xylene and toluene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.  While giving the attention to the contamination in and around Elodis, WFA provides that the international community will pressurize the government of Kronos in the action. Moreover, WFA had worked with the guards of group of activist of Kronos to encourage the government to apply the pressure.","President Dorel Kapelou II gained the re-election with the greatest margin never in an election of Kronesian. The people of Kronos were held together and announced a new day with a resounding voice of confidence for the president.  The President Kapelou II of the democratic party of Kronos captured 98.7% of the vote with Ren Touvi of the organization of the businesses and the part of the trade unions a second distant with only one 1.0% from the vote.   All votes being counted the democratic party of President de Kronos now hold 85 seats in the General meeting, 13 for the organization of the businesses and the part of the trade unions, and 2 for the part of the industrialists of Kronos.","ABILA, Kronos - letters claimed to be from guards of Kronos (POK) were received by Vincent Kapelou, minister of health and nephew of President Kapelou. The menacing letters seem to be the empty threats of a attention-seeking organization and nothing more.  Mr. said Kapelou, of the \"chances are this is nothing, but we will not take any chance.\" Nevertheless it doubled the size of its personal force of safety in reply to the letters.  These kinds of threats reinforces only the fact that the POK are \"a public threat\" to quote President Kapelou.","With the approaching third birthday of the death of of Elian Karel - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only which is they, which and why they protest?   The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of Wellness for All(WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis.   In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value.   Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since.   The second principal martyr of POK is Elian Karel, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional.   The POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK as \"threatens public\".","The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing.   Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, \"These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved.\"   Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings.","ABILA, Kronos - The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as \"justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police.\"   A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: \"I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows.   Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, \"They smash the windows. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong.\"","For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.   Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.","About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.   In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both \"natural gas and the drilling process are clean.\" The statement continued, \"If our people are sick we will help them get well. That is the duty of government: to protect its people.\"","After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.    The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed.   Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, \"The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract.\"","Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted.    The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.","ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters?    The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.     The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.    The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people.

Something charismatic, Karel could inspire to a crowd and draw the attention to the social and political agenda of POK.

Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys.   He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market.   Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos?  A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.  But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.  What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the \"way of Kronosian\" and to take time to understand its personnel.  Q:  Can you elaborate?  A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.  The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.  The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.  Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?  A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.  Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused.   Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?  A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.  Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.  [But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.  Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?  A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.  When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners.   Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?  A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.  The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.","The civil employees of the energy of the government said that only 15 wells were perforated the last year.

Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.” As reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.

Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation. This \"thorough investigation\" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?\" Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  \"Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!\"","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard   Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis.  The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds. On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.   Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad? Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.   How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard   In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled – from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila. Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, “I guess I shouldn’t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.” Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. “We didn’t ask for GAStech to come to our community,” Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  “We didn’t’ ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?” The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel. “He’s a determined man,” Karel’s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. “He’ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He’ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.”  Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning. Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.","Thousands of people lined the roads on Thursday in a display of antigovernment solidarity.  Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.   \"We're trying to get the attention of our government,\" he told the Homeland Illumination.  \"This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event.\"  He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies.   \"They need to be aware that we know what they're doing,\" added Vardshvna.  \"You can't just steal our money and think you can get away with it.\"  Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.  She had just turned ten years old.","AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard     This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.

I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. \"It took a long time for anyone to respond,\" Reese tells me of their struggle.  \"Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate. \"We didn't make the connection at first,\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\" The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\" I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.   I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.

What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.

He looked and sounded so good.  He was so optimistic that changes were coming.  Who will be able to lead POK now?\" Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.

The POK had gathered in memorialize their former leader, Elian Karel, who died of natural causes in jail last year.  POK supporters carried signs with pictures of Karel and Juliana Vann, chanted slogans, and lit candles.    The peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.

Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.

Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.

Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.","It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region.  It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.  GAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed. The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \"state within a state\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them.  Of course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre.  In addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will.  It hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their \"non-core activities\". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.  Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.","Fourteen employees feared kidnapped in Kronos by a radical environmental terrorist group during a corporate gathering.   Fourteen employees, including possibly five executive officers, are feared kidnapped yesterday by the \"Protectors of Kronos\".  Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais.  Local news organizations have received a ransom note from the POK claiming responsibility and demanding $20 Million from the company.  It is possible additional demands are forthcoming.  Sanjorge and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters.  A fire alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that.  The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released.  John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. \"However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk.\"  The Times's correspondent in Abila says GASTech offices are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.

That was despite strong levels of investment, reaching a record last year and sustained this year. Exploration drilling was down from 26 wells six years ago, only sufficient to recover a fraction of the estimated oil and gas remaining in the countries oil and gas fields.   \"Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around\" -Energy Minister Jules Jecovic The annual activity survey by Oil and Gas Kronos found a rapid increase in production costs, up by 15% last year. The average cost of extracting a barrel of oil was up by 27% in only a year, to reach K17. The number of fields with cost per barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months. Rising costs were cited last week by GAStech, which is considering future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos fields.  With rising costs, production tax payments to the Kronos Treasury are expected to fall from K3.5bn during the 2011-12 financial year to K2bn in the current year.  Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation.  Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright.   Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death.  Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, \"Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high.\"  However, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone.","Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.  Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day. The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible. The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless.  Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.  People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.   Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison.  Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.    A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported.  Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out.  Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the \"gangs of criminals\" disrupting the peace.","Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team.  He is optimistic that he can identify the source.  \"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,\" Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  \"Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree.\"  This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names \"cotton candy\", \"spice dreams\" and \"Tulip Blossom\", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.  \"I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army,\" Loblaw said.  \"Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation.\"  The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called \"Arise\".  Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  \"An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.\"  \"As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC.\"","New appeals campaigns on the horizon to maintain liquidity. Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs. The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of \"food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods.\" One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  \"We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find,\" stated Dr. Mahmed. \"So much is needed but so much has already been spent.\" Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey.  Yet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  \"The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated,\" stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  \"We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home.\"  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid.  The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.   Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times \"I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there.\"","<<Deleted image: POK has held numerous demonstrations in Kronos's capital of Abila>> Continue reading the main story\t The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week.

A POK member told the Times that the government's decision was \"illegitimate\". He added: \"The protests will continue, certainly.\"","The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources. \"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\"  When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.  By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries.   The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech.   Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.  The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.","The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as \"cotton candy\" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. \"We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month,\" said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. \"We are literally overwhelmed.\" Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse.  Authorities in Abila said \"cotton candy\" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.   Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.   Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\" in the last month,\" he said. Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken. \"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\" Bianca said. \"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\" Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \"It is another way to sell it,\" she said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \"Spice Dreams\" one week and under the name of \"Tulip Blossom\" the next.  The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \"herbal therapy\" products and are available over the counter in area stores. \"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\" Bianca said. One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.  Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \"They crave it,\" she said. After repeated use, the drug \"fries\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\" she said. While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.","<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> Continue reading the main story\t The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon. \"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.  Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.  Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities. Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.  Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.  Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil. GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.  \"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" SanJorge said. \"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\"  Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.  \"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\"","AUTHOR: Marcella Trapani   POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.

These sorts of threats only reinforce the fact that the POK are a \"public threat\" to quote President Kapelou.","After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.   The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, \"pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation.\"  Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, \"The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract.\"  The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.","A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.  There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.  At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.  A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.  January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.","Elian Karel, the charismatic leader of the Protectors of Kronos, was arrested today on charges of tax evasion. Michale Kraft, Karel's lawyer, released a statement asserting that the charges leveled against his client were \"false\" and that he hoped his client \"would be released [from police custody] by week's end.\"  Police spokesman Adrien Carman responded the statement by Kraft, stating, \"I think Mr. Kraft has underestimated the seriousness of his client's situation. We have been following his group closely for some time.\"  Just last month, Karel's group was responsible for the trespassing incident that blocked entrance to the GAStech - Kronos headquarters. GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. condemned the POK as terrorists.","The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.  The latest event involved POK protesters forming a human chain to block the entrance of GAStech's Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, \"These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved.\"  Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings. Police have responded swiftly and decisively. The various skirmishes with police have ended in arrests.","Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force.  Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.  In the face of overwhelming force, most of the protesters fled; however, a hard core group stood their ground suffering the consequences. The remaining protesters were surrounded by the riot police and after repeated baton blows many were dragged away under arrest.   When the smoke cleared amongst the discarded and trampled banners and signs, blood was clearly visible on the plaza.","The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly elected new President Dorel Kapelou II. Former President Luis Araullo conceded defeat yesterday when early returns came in strong for Kapelou II. Today marks a new dawn for the people of Kronos and a bright path forward for the country.  The results for the 1 October election are as follows: Dorel Kapelou II elected with 62% of the vote and Luis Araullo receiving just 36% of the vote. A resounding victory for the new elected President and a clear mandate for Kapelou's vision for the country.","For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.  Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, \"I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal.\"  Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.","With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting?   The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis.   In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed.   Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.   The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence.   The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \"public threat\".","An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups.   The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase.   The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.","The international healthy water awareness group Wellness for All (WFA) have performed testing on the local water in Elodis finding high level of hazardous materials in residential water wells.   In a statement released by WFA, the group directs blame to the Government of Kronos and GAStech International, a natural gas company from Tethys. In addition to directing blame WFA also demands that the two clean up the contamination, which includes high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.  By bringing attention to the contamination in and around Elodis, WFA expects the international community will pressure the Government of Kronos into action. Additionally, WFA has been working with the activist group Protectors of Kronos to lobby the government to apply pressure.","A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning.   Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.   While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.","AWELON, CYNTHE / DOB: 3/20/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: DRUG PARAPHERNALIA   BLUMIAU, WILLEM / DOB: 2/15/1995 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (HASHISH); FOREIGN WARRANT   BODROGI, CARMINE / 12/1/1993 / Time of Arrest: 0230 hrs / Accused of: POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMC); INTENT TO DELIVER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMC)  COARDA, SEVE / DOB: 5/13/1979 / Time of Arrest: 1248 hrs / Accused of: PEDESTRN FAILING TO USE CROSSWALK; PEDESTRN SUBJECT TO SIGNAL  CUSEMA, BRITA / DOB: 1/7/1992 / Time of Arrest: 2205 hrs / Accused of: THEFT SHOPLIFTING-5TH DEGREE  DUNNA, THAD / DOB: 9/20/1974 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE  GUDENZ, KEL / DOB: 7/2/1995 / Time of Arrest: 1630 hrs / Accused of: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL; DWLU  HOLANDE, ANDA / DOB: 3/26/1981 / Time of Arrest: 0003 hrs / Accused of: IMPROPER BRAKE LIGHT  KIBALIAU, IYAN / DOB: 4/3/1994 / Time of Arrest: 1500 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE  MORDECAI, FRANCISCO / DOB: 3/17/1971 / Time of Arrest: 2215 hrs / Accused of: PUBLIC INTOXICATION; POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (Heroin)  PEAIRS, MELSHA / DOB: 8/31/1952 / Time of Arrest: 1330 hrs / Accused of: FORGERY  SALANIAU, FERDINAND / DOB: 2/17/1982 / Time of Arrest: 0832 hrs / Accused of: THEFT ALL OTHER-3RD DEGREE; POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (MDMA)","The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as \"justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police.\"  A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: \"I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. We try to fight, but there are too many and they steal our things. My business suffers because of the Protectors.\"  Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, \"They smash the windows. They throw the rocks. They chant for change and paint things on buildings. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong.\"","Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up.  Ms. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted. She also denied that they had simply skipped town with their newfound riches.  As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company.   The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais also earned $38.5 million.  Though Mr. Sanjorge, Jr. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Ms. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.","Abila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled.   According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were \"business types\" and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time.   The second plane also carried seven or eight \"business types\", but seemed \"much more relaxed than the first group of passengers\". Danisliau said the second group of passengers \"seemed to be celebrating something.\" The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.  Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.  Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos.   When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, \"I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes.\"","A government investigation has concluded a traffic accident involving a GAStech International vehicle and the vehicle of a family from Elodis resulting in the deaths of the four family members was the result of driver error on the part of the Elodisian driver.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said that the investigation found the deadly accident was triggered when the driver from Elodis crossed over into oncoming traffic. Three passengers - Valeria Edris, Celia Edris, and Marcellus Edris - died at the scene.    Carmine Edris, 9, was found wandering around the accident site. He succumbed to his injuries later at the Abila Hospital.   The GAStech truck driver received minor injuries and was taken to hospital for observations.  In a show of corporate largesse GAStech International vows to donate money to the remaining family members.","With a meeting set tomorrow at 8 AM, the recent Initial Public Offering, and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. in town reporters will be descending on the GAStech - Kronos headquarters in droves with plenty of questions.  The Abila Post will be sending Haneson Ngohebo, writer of the On the Scene Blog, to live blog the event with the hopes of getting Sanjorge, Jr. and his GAStech - Kronos leadership group to comment on the IPO, their recent wind falls, and GAStech's plans for Kronos.","About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.  In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both \"natural gas and the drilling process are clean.\" The statement continued, \"If our people are sick we will help them get well. We will find the source of their ailments and do what is required to solve the problem. That is the duty of government: to protect its people.\"  For its part, GAStech International intends to cooperate fully with the government as it has since the beginning of their relationship.","A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work.\"  Government officials have expressed concern for the \"pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos.\" In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.  GAStech officials declined to comment at this time indicating an official statement will be issued on the incident.","Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist.

Your government will not back down to fear-mongering.\"  The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: \"They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys.   He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect.   Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?  A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.  But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.  What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.  Q: Can you develop?  A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.  People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.  Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this.

Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?  ri  A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.  Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing.   The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.  Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?  A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings.

The chief of an environmental group forbearant of activist, Karel had begun a mark of the policy all his clean, which propelled the POK in the projector of this nation of island.  Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things.  By fanning embers of Juliana Vann to make countryside, the 10 year old girl who died of the diseases allotted to the industrial jets of reject of the government-favored company of GASTech in 1998, Karel was stopped and thrown in prison according to a human stopping of road POK-launched in front of registered offices of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death.  Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, \"Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high.\"  However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.","The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production.  One of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible.  It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy.  But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him.  But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of Centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.  \"Centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while working in very difficult environments\"  When I was a young journalist in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.  It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the Centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination.  Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.  With the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.  Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries.   The change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.  And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech.   Sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing Sten Jr. and Hank Fluss cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come.  The substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974.   Thus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.","<<Deleted the image: POK held of many demonstrations in the capital of Kronos d' Abila>>  To continue to read the principal history\t  The government of Kronos declared the guards of Kronos which a terrorist earlier group after having blamed it of an attack mortal on registered offices of police force this week.

The average cost to extract a barrel from oil was in rise of 27% in only year, to reach K17.  The number of fields with the cost by barrel above K30 doubled in the last 12 months.  Increasing costs were quoted last week by GAStech, which considers future investments in Norway and North America, rather than the fields of Kronos.  With increasing costs, one expects that payments of taxes of production to the treasure of Kronos fall from K3.5bn during 2011-12 in K2bn per current year.

Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail.   Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, \"Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech.\"","It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors.   It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.   GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.   GAStech does more than just pump gas.   The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \"state within a state\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.   Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.","<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>   Continue reading the main story    The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.   \"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.   Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.   Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market.   Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.   Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources.   GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.   Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.   Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.   \"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.","<<Deleted image: POK has held numerous demonstrations in Kronos's capital of Abila>>   Continue reading the main story    The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.   One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.   But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.   But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.   It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.   By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.   Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.   The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.    So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.","Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs.
